You will need Neovim v0.11.0, for some plugins require that. You can download from here `https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md`.

Go inside `~/.config`, and there `git clone https://github.com/YerdosNar/Neovim.git`. Rename with `mv Neovim nvim`. Open `nvim`. Inside run `:PackerSync`. And if you want to install LSPs, run `:Mason`
