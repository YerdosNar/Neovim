You will need Neovim v0.11.0, for some plugins require that. You can download from here `https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md`.
After `git clone https://github.com/YerdosNar/Neovim.git`, you will need to run `:PackerSync` inside Nvim.
After that you can easily install different LSPs by running `:Mason` inside Nvim.
